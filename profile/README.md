# Team Frankies

Hi there ðŸ‘‹

We are a group of developers, which was formed randomly in the fourth edition of the [programacion-es.dev's ](https://programacion-es.dev) Devathon.
Due to the group's losses, we were nicknamed the Frankensteins because of the spare parts we had. We still managed to come in first place ðŸ¥‡.

After this we decided to continue together with the development of the project.
